# Ideas
## The Curse
* People are afflicted with the "Curse of Transience", which causes people to leave their bodies when they die.
  * People who die in Midgard are sent to Helheim.
  * Their body will have a presence in Helheim.
* If a person is able to return to their body before it gets destroyed, they can return to the world of the living.
* If someone were to die in Helheim they're sent to Niflhel to rot forever. There's no turning back from here. They die for good.
* If a body deteriorates or gets destroyed before it can be re-inhabited, the soul is left to wander Helheim.
## The World
* The world is split into two different realms: Midgard and Helheim (placeholder names).
* Midgard serves as the land of the living where people go about their ways in the usual way.
* Helheim is a twisted _underworld_.
  It is a twisted version of Midgard, containing most of its geographic and urban features, but with one notable difference: It is inhabited by the lost souls that died in Midgard.
## Hollows/Husks
People who wander out into the wilderness may encounter malicious spirits, some of which may extract and/or destroy someone's soul "for fun".
If that were to happen, the person's body would be left to wander the earth aimlessly with no mind or reason of their own.
These husks are empty vessels capable of carrying a new soul.
Through the proper channels, a soul that lost its body is able to gain residence in a husk, bonding to it, making it their own.
It sometimes happens that the soul and body aren't perfect matches, which causes "soul sickness".
## Guilds Instead of Classes
The game uses different guilds which focus on different aspects of life as the basis of the "class" system.
People in the Mason's Guild for example could have a natural bonus to dexterity or intelligence, while people in the Royal Guard might favour srength and agility.
## Races and Bestiary
The general set of creatures for the setting would be pulled from German, Slavic, and Nordic folklore while trying to steer as clear of Tolkien as possible.
The setting would make heavy use of Nisse, Trolls, Witches, and Ice Giants (Jotun) as races rather than the usual slew of Orcs and Elves commonly found in fantasy games.
