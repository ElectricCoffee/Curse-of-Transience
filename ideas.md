# Ideas
## The Curse
* People are afflicted with the "Curse of Transience", which causes people to leave their bodies when they die.
  * People who die in Saoghaal are sent to Helheim.
  * Their body will have a presence in Helheim.
* If a person is able to return to their body before it gets destroyed, they can return to the world of the living.
* If someone were to die in Helheim they're sent to Niflhel to rot forever. There's no turning back from here. They die for good.
* If a body deteriorates or gets destroyed before it can be re-inhabited, the soul is left to wander Helheim.
## The World
* The world is split into two different realms: Saoghaal and Helheim (placeholder names).
* Saoghaal serves as the land of the living where people go about their ways in the usual way.
* Helheim is a twisted _underworld_.
  It is a twisted version of Saoghaal, containing most of its geographic and urban features, but with one notable difference: It is inhabited by the lost souls that died in Saoghaal.
* The main game takes place on a fraction of the world map
  * One nation of industrialised desert dwellers that have taken on colonising the continent.
  * An empire that is also invading the continent.
  * Loose coalition of similar cultures make up one "nation" as a defensive strategy against the invading nations.

## Husks
People who wander out into the wilderness may encounter malicious spirits, some of which may extract and/or destroy someone's soul "for fun".
If that were to happen, the person's body would be left to wander the earth aimlessly with no mind or reason of their own.
These husks are empty vessels capable of carrying a new soul.
Through the proper channels, a soul that lost its body is able to gain residence in a husk, bonding to it, making it their own.
It sometimes happens that the soul and body aren't perfect matches, which causes "soul sickness".
## Soul Sickness
Shades are capable of possessing any available body they want, but might risk contracting Soul Sickness if not aided by a ritual.
The ritual's purpose is to relieve the maddening pain caused by entering a foreign body.
If the person's will isn't strong enough to withstand this pain, their mind risks cracking.
The Soul Sickness gets worse with each successive takeover.

People inflicted with Soul Sickness often show signs of paranoia and have nervous ticks.
### Soul Frenzy
In its most severe stages, Soul Sickness will deprive a Shade from their former sanity, causing them to become addicted to dying.

Frenzied Shades will often seek out any available body they can find, regardless of species or condition, just so they can die again.
## Guilds and Organisations
The game uses different guilds which focus on different aspects of life as the basis of the "class" system.
People in the Mason's Guild for example could have a natural bonus to dexterity or intelligence, while people in the Royal Guard might favour srength and agility.
## Races and Bestiary
The general set of creatures for the setting would be pulled from German, Slavic, and Nordic folklore while trying to steer as clear of Tolkien as possible.
The setting would make heavy use of Nisse, Trolls, Witches, and Ice Giants (Jotun) as races rather than the usual slew of Orcs and Elves commonly found in fantasy games.
## Religions
* A church dedicated to the eradication of nonhuman spirits who invade husks.
  * A sect of which also kills humans who have been resurrected
* A cult who believes ressurection is wrong
* Engineering religion -- The College of Apxiv -- dedicated to the development of the mind and tech.
  * They are super secretive about their technological breakthrough, so are unlikely to share it with the outside world
  * They are situated on a mountain secluded from most of the world.
    Over time, they eventually hollowed out the mountain and started using that as their archive.
## Money
Different cultures will have different currencies.
* One culture may value steel more than gold, and thus have an entire monetary system based around using weights of steel and copper as their monetary currency.
* One may use simple bartering to get by
* One is already on fiat money, using paper banknotes.
## Schools of Magic
### Wizardry / Sorcery
* Is an "exact science".
* Uses spellbooks with precise spells that have a precise meaning and definition.
* Maybe subdivided into sorceries and rituals.
### Thermomancy
* Is based on emotion.
* Uses no spellbook of any kind, but rather has one or two basic spells that can be manipulated based on the individual's needs.
* Spells grow stronger with player skill.
* Often carries "catalytic materials" like water and wood in order to augment the thermal spells.
### Bardery
* Is based on songs.
* Songs pull on people's emotions in specific ways and can therefore be used to inspire, mourn, or even heal. Songs therefore act more as passive modifiers than actual spells with effect.
* Spells require magical instruments imbued with bardic essence in order to be usable as bardic catalysts.
