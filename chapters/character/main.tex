\chapter{Character Creation}
Creating a character in Siren is an important first step before one can start playing the game.
It is recommended that you, as a player discuss the creation of your character with the Game Master (GM) and the other players in your group, to ensure good synergy.
Character creation happens in the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select a Race 
    \item Select a starting Guild 
    \item Build your character
    \item Apply the attribute bonuses granted to you by your chosen race and guild
\end{enumerate}

\section{Selecting a Race}
The first thing you will want to do, is select a race that you want to play.
A good choice for a first-time player is always the tried and true human (see Section~\ref{sec:human}).
The race serves as the lens through which your character views and interacts with the world.
Some races are naturally gifted with magic, while other races are more technologically adept.
Your choice essentially boils down to personal preference; no choice is wrong.

Chapter~\ref{chap:races} provides an in-depth list of playable races that we have crafted for this setting; future modules may or may not include more playable races.

\paragraph{Important}
Once you have chosen the race you want to play, note down its attribute bonuses, these will come in handy in step 4 of your character creation.
