\section{The College of Apxiv}
The College of Apxiv is a secretive organisation located somewhere in the Hallan Alps.
Its primary goal is complete and utter dedication to the studies of science and mathematics.
It is rumoured that the college has developed technology far more advanced than that found anywhere else in the world.
This tech is said to be kept in a large vault deep within the mountain range.

Members of this guild are usually integrated into the various local communities throughout the world, often taking up technical jobs like blacksmiths, machinists, watch makers, or doctors.
Their job is threefold: to help their local communities, to keep an eye on any gifted individuals that might serve the College, and to ensure any misuse of technology doesn't go unstopped.
None of the integrated members will ever publicly admit to know anything about the college, but all of them wear a piece of jewelry marked with the College's insignia as a means of mutual recognition.
