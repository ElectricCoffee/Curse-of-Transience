\section{Husks -- Empty Vessels of People Past}
Husks are the living bodies of people who have lost their souls.
Husks tend to wander around aimlessly and do not appear to have any real cognitive function beyond the rudimentary bodily functions, such as breathing.
Husks have been recorded to be performing menial tasks, sometimes assited by magic for better performance.
Husks are characterised by a low groan, a distinct lack of appetite, as well a glassy-eyed empty stare.

Husks are created by extracting the soul of a living creature without killing it first.
Witches and mischievious forest spirits are known to do this to unlucky passers-by on occasion, but it has been rumoured that cults in the North have been extracting souls en-masse, increasing the number of Husks spotted by the local populus.

Being empty vessels, Husks are capable of housing new souls.
Once a soul has been attached to a Husk, that Husk becomes its new permanent body and will \textit{mostly} function as normal.
Souls that have switched Husks too many times will eventually develop \textit{Soul Sickness},  characterised by restlessness, emotional distance, failure to fully acclimatize to the use of their new body, and eventually even loss of sanity.
