\section{Sirens -- Winged Vocal Charmers}
Creatures known for their beautiful enchanting songs, said to be the progenitors of bardic magic.
They are characterised by their humanoid shape, feathreed bodies, bird-like feet, wings, and short stature, rarely growing taller than 5'5".
The expected lifespan of a siren is around 65 years.
Legend has it that sirens used to be regular humans that once got cursed by an evil sorceror eons ago, dooming them to walk the earth as bird-people.

Sirens are often found near large bodies of water, typically at sea, where they will live most of their lives.
Their song has been said to cause shipwrecks, although no solid evidence towards this has ever been provided.
Sirens are generally known to be mild-mannered and meek.

Sirens typically live in small villages, but have been known to live in the larger human seaside settlements such as \textit{Sparr} and \textit{Chapman's Haven}.
Sirens don't normally wear clothes unless surrounded by humans or other clothes-wearing peoples, but to them wearing clothes is more a sign of solidarity and respect for the people they live among, moreso than out of necessity.
