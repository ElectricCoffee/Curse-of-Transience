\section{Nisse -- Household Spirits}
Nisses are small magical household beings that live within the walls and under the floorboards of just about every house in and around Saoghaal.
They generally keep to themselves and tend to stay out of sight at all cost, but may cause trouble if angered.
It is customary to leave out food for the household nisse in order to uphold good relations.

Seeing a nisse is generally considered good luck in the northern regions of Saoghaal, while the very idea of them is shunned further south.
