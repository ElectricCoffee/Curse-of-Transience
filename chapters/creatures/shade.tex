\section{Shades -- The Souls of The Transient}\label{sec:shade}
The cursed souls of the deceased creatures of the material plane.
They technically do not posess a shape, but more often than not, they take on the shape of the body they are familiar with.

The longer Shades stay in Niflhel, the less they remember their own appearance, thus losing their \textit{humanity} over time.
Shades have the ability to re-enter the material plane by simply locating their bodies and re-merging with them.
In the event that their bodies have been destroyed in the material plane, a shade can return through a procedure known as a \textit{Soul Graft}.

Scholars note that while it might theoretically be possible to graft multiple souls onto the same Husk, they're quick to point out it has never been done for ethical reasons.

Shades who die in Niflhel die for good.
