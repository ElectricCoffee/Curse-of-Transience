\section{Humans}\label{sec:human}
Your standard garden variety person.
Comes in all sorts of shapes, sizes and colours.
Generally lazy, yet territorial.

Human kingdoms cover most of Saoghaal's coastal areas, thinning out into smaller settlements towards the more inhospitable areas of the region.

\paragraph{Physical Description}
Humans are bipedal creatures that come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.
Adult humans typically have sizes ranging from between around 1.5m to around 2.1m.
Skin and hair colour varies by region of origin, but typically ranges from various shades of tan to dark brown.

\paragraph{Society}
Humans have the widest variety of societal structures of any races in Saoghaal.
Ranging from feudalist empires, to elective monarchies, to democracies, there is almost no limit to the kinds of societal structure present within Saoghaal.

\paragraph{Relations}
The expansionist and territorial nature of humans means they've interacted with most---if not all---other races at some point in their history.
Whether it be through war, exploration, diplomacy, or slavery; humans have managed to make a name for themselves in every corner of the world.

\paragraph{View on the Undead}
The humans' view on the undead is about as varied as their cultures.
Some view the Curse's ability to bring people back to life as just another aspect of life, while others outright condemn it.
