\chapter{Magic}
The world is about as magical as it is mundane.
Every living creature, every word uttered, every thing imaginable has traces of magic within.

In the region of Saoghaal, three different ``schools'' of magic exist: \textit{Bardry}, \textit{Sorcery}, and \textit{Thermomancy}.
Each of these three schools serve different purposes, require different rituals, and are fundamentally incompatible with each other.
