\section{Charging a Spell}
A character can charge a spell if they wish to increase its power.
You can charge a spell by multiplying the amount of mana used the cast it;
this also multiplies its potency.
Every level of charging requires a new dice roll to maintain concentration, if any of them fail, the whole spell fails.

During combat, charging a spell takes multiple rounds.
If you want to cast a spell that is three times more powerful than normal, casting it takes 3 whole rounds of charging.
You lose any and all charge if you get distracted (damaged, tripping, etc.).

\paragraph{Example} Harold wants to burn a troll he and his party are fighting.
His fire spell consumes 5 MP, and decides to charge it for three turns.
At the beginning of his third turn, Harold unleashes an enormous cone of fire from the tip of his wand, consuming 15 MP in the process.
