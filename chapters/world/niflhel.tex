\section{Niflhel -- The Underworld}
Niflhel is a twisted, incomplete, and broken depiction of the material plane.
It is a patchwork of how its inhabitants remembered the material plane.
It roughly coinsides with \textit{reality}, but due to its many inhabitants, the combined memory contains discrepensies.

Niflhel is in part inhabited by the spirits of creatures who died in the material plane, and in part by predatory creatures native to the land.
The spirits go by many names, but are commonly referred to as \textit{Shades} (See Section~\ref{sec:shade}).

Due to Niflhel's nature, the land isn't divided into countries per se, although small organised settlements of people do exist within this realm.
